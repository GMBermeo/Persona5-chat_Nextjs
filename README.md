# Persona's Metaverse Web Chat (イセカイ) - Imersão React 2022
Project made for Alura's Coding Bootcamp of React with Next.js in January of 2022. The idea was to create a working web app connected to a Supabase database using the SkynexUI library in 5 days.
My version of the application is stylized as seen in Persona 5, to do that I've coded functions to randomly rotate elements and randomly generate borders.
This was my first experience with React.
